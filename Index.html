        <p1>We set up a small shop in the Atrium mall and started importing specialised ranges of sweets and chocolates from Italy, France, and some of the Asian markets where they have very different varieties.
            Since we opened our website word has got around and now the majority of our sales are online. Please email an order to us and we will endeavour to fulfil your needs.
            Thanks for your continuing support.
